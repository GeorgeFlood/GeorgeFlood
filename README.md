**<h3>Digital Craftsman (Front-end Developer)</h3>**

<pHello, my name is George👋 and I am a front-end engineer, or as I like to call myself, a digital craftsman. I am based in London, where I spend my days crafting beautiful user experiences that leave people feeling like they just walked out of a fancy artisanal bakery. When I'm not coding, you can find me sipping on a flat white and trying to convince people that I am indeed British (despite the fact that I can't drink tea without adding at least five sugars). Anyway, thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy my creations as much as I enjoy making them!</p>
