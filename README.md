**<h3>Digital Craftsman (Front-end Developer)</h3>**

<p style="color: orange";>Greetings👋, fellow earthlings! Allow me to introduce myself - I am George, a highly advanced being from the planet of 'Sunny London'. While I may appear to be a mere mortal, I am actually a web development God, capable of creating stunning websites with just a few keystrokes. In the name of all that is good and logical (and also because it's just plain fun), I dedicate my time to mastering the art of coding. So if you need a website that's out of this world, look no further - I'm your guy!</p>
