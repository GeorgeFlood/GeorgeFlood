**<h3>Digital Craftsman (Front-end Developer)</h3>**

<p>Greetings👋!

And welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a front-end developer with a passion for building beautiful and functional websites using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript/React. I consider myself a digital craftsman, always striving to hone my skills and create the best possible user experience. On my profile, you'll find a collection of my projects (or check my portfolio for the live projects), each one representing my technical abilities and my dedication to continuous learning. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoyed creating it. Thank you for visiting, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.</p>
